# We have added the @register.simple_tag decorator to the function, to register it as a simple tag.
# Django will use this function's name as the tag name.
# If you want to register it using a different name, you can do so by specifying a name attribute,
# such as @register.simple_tag(name='my_tag')

    # Post.published starts with all your published posts
    # .annotate(total_comments=Count('comments')) adds a new calculated field to each post that counts how many
    # comments it has. Think of it like adding a sticky note to each post with its comment count.
    # .order_by('-total_comments') sorts the posts by their comment count, with the minus sign meaning
    # "highest to lowest" (like arranging posts from most commented to least commented)
    # [:count] takes just the top few posts based on the count parameter we specified

# The function markdown_format(text) takes the raw text (containing Markdown syntax) and:
#
# Uses markdown.markdown(text) to convert Markdown to HTML
# Wraps with mark_safe() to tell Django this HTML is safe to render
# Returns the safe HTML
#
# This lets you write blog posts in Markdown and automatically convert them to properly
# formatted HTML in your templates using {{ post.body|markdown }}.

# NOTE
# In Django, HTML content is escaped by default for security. Use mark_safe cautiously,
# only on content you control. Avoid using mark_safe on any content submitted by
# non-staff users to prevent security vulnerabilities.
